    "# Course Mini-project\n",
    "You will find below the list of mini-project proposed. You will be forming teams and each team will be assigned to one of the projects. Here are some points that you need to understand before starting work:\n",
    " \n",
    "- Before starting the implementation, make sure to clearly define with your colleagues in the team the role of each one of you, and the task that needs to be fulfilled. Try to adopt for that the agile (Scrum) methodology if you are familiar with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code I provided you with is more of a pseudo-code that leaves much to be done. So, take it with a pinch of salt. If you would like to change the signature of given modules (that is the input and output of a given module), to add a new module or remove an existing one, then that is possible provided that we discuss that beforehand. \n",
    "\n",
    "- I added on the webpage of the course, examples of CSV files that can be used for testing purposes.\n",

    "- You will have three weeks or so to complete the whole project. I will get back to you later for a demonstration date. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If you don't manage to complete the project assigned for you, then it is essential that you clearly identify the parts that you have successfully implemented and tested. \n",

    "- Outcome: No need for a written report. A well documented jupyter notebook is preferred. As well as documenting your work, you will need to state in the notebook who did what."
